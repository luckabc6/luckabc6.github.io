<meta name="description" content="5 Tips for Preparing for GMAT as an Introvert In order to attend B-school, you will most likely need to get a strong score on the GMAT, although some schools are going test-optional. But for those of you introverts who need to take the GMAT, there are lots of things you can do to make sure you’re getting a strong score. The GMAT is a unique test in that it is adaptive to the test taker - as you get questions in an area correct, it will ask you more challenging questions. If you get questions incorrect, it will scale down the next question it asks you in that area. This is to determine precisely where you fall in the different subject areas tested by this exam. You will need to practice and study for this exam, but rest assured, here are some tips to get you started. 1. Set aside time each day for the study practice Preparing for the GMAT Course will take significant time and effort. While it is possible to study for it in as little as two months, most test prep plans involve spending one to four hours a day working on studying. As an introvert, this should come easy. But it’s still important to carve out time specifically for studying and to stick to that plan. 2. Understand the format of the test The GMAT consists of four distinct sections. Understanding what each of these sections requires is key to getting a high GMAT score. Each section will require you to apply different types of skills and will consist of different amounts of time and types of questions. You will have a choice in the order in which you work on each section, so knowing your testing preferences is important as well. Know which sections you feel most and least confident with so you can plan accordingly. 3. Identify your strengths and weaknesses There is a wealth of information about the GMAT online. There are lots of practice tests available that you can use to see what you know and what you need to study or learn. Use these to your advantage. There’s no sense in spending lots of time studying the material you already have mastered, better to use that time studying something you still need to practice instead. Don’t forget to use these benchmark practice tests throughout your studying time so you can continue to tailor your study plan to what you need to work on most. 4. Choose appropriate study guides There are so many study guides available on the market for the GMAT and they come in all different kinds of formats too. Knowing how you learn best will help you narrow down what kind of test guide to get, but only by doing research on the specific guides available will you know which study guide is truly going to work the best for you. Another thing to consider is how much time you have available to study and when you plan on taking the test. Some guides are made for a couple of months of study, while others are made for weeks. Keeping all of this in mind will help you make the most of your study time. 5. Consider the support of a tutor or take a class While you might be thinking that taking a class to master the GMAT might be a bit out of your comfort zone, know that there are lots of online pre-recorded options available. You can also seek out an experienced tutor in the area you need the most support and schedule one on one time to get help. Some tutors have you set up a plan, with weekly meetings. Others will operate on a one-off basis as needed. Again, doing research will help you choose your best path." />
